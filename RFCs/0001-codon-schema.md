# Codon Spec v1 — Sirraya Protocol

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Origin & Vision

The **Sirraya Protocol** was envisioned and initiated by Mr. Amir Hameed Mir to create a future where **intents can be emitted as living data objects**, ambiently, across any environment — without the need for traditional UI, servers, or persistent connections.

Inspired by biology, cryptography, and decentralized computing, Sirraya introduces a new programmable primitive: the **Codon** — a self-contained sequence of action, identity, context, and trust.

This spec defines **Codon Spec v1**, the first formal RFC for how Codons behave, how they are created, parsed, resolved, mutated, and transmitted.

---

### 1.2 What is a Codon?

A **Codon** is a lightweight, self-contained, verifiable unit of intent — designed to be emitted ambiently (via air, QR, BLE, internet, SMS, mesh, etc.) and resolved only by the device, agent, or system it was meant for.

Think of it as a **genetic instruction for software** — it carries:
- An action or purpose
- Contextual metadata (time, domain, location, etc.)
- Optional payload
- Identity or signature of issuer
- A `teleomere`, determining its lifespan & pickup filters

---

### 1.3 Sirraya Components

Sirraya is composed of modular parts:

| Component   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `codon`     | The main instruction packet — carries intent, context, identity             |
| `parser`    | Lightweight interpreter that parses codon string into usable structure      |
| `resolver`  | The agent/device/system that decides whether to act on a codon              |
| `handler`   | A function or module invoked after successful parsing & resolution          |
| `teleomere` | An expiry & targeting mechanism — limits who can see/resolve the codon      |
| `emitter`   | Any device/system that emits or broadcasts codons (intentionally or passively) |

---

### 1.4 Ambient & Agnostic by Design

Sirraya is:

- **Transport agnostic**: Works over BLE, NFC, QR, internet, mesh, SMS, satellite
- **User agnostic**: Doesn’t rely on logins or cloud sessions
- **Device agnostic**: Can be parsed on IoT devices, phones, wearables, cloud
- **Domain agnostic**: Works in smart cities, events, homes, defense, logistics
- **Offline-first**: Doesn’t require the internet or persistent storage
- **Privacy-respecting**: No tracking, no surveillance, no logging needed

---

### 1.5 Structure of a Codon

Each codon follows a structured but human-readable format:                 CODON:ACTION|CONTEXT|PAYLOAD|META|TELEOMERE

A sample Codon looks like:-                                                CODON:LOGIN|web.amsaa.co|user@xyz|sig=123x|exp=5m,target=device:smartlock01

1.6 Mutation

Codons are mutable on the edge — meaning they can evolve if emitted by agents that build new layers:


                                                                            Original: CODON:DISPLAY|menu|samosa,chai|exp=2m

                                                                            Mutated:  CODON:DISPLAY|menu|samosa,chai|exp=2m+5s|added:jalebi

Mutation allows emergent computing and peer modification in local networks.

1.7 Why Codons are Revolutionary

Traditional UX	                                                       Sirraya Codon UX
Requires App + Backend	                                               Codon can work offline, no server needed
Requires UI interaction	                                               Zero UI — just emit and wait for resolution
Depends on central auth	                                               Codon can contain verifiable identity or be ephemeral
Pushes to everyone	                                                   Codon resolves only if it matches device + rules
Logs every event	                                                   Sirraya does not log or track unless resolver decides

Codons enable selective, invisible, ambient interaction — like whispering in a crowd of a million, and only the intended ear hears it.

1.8 Example Use Cases

Instant Login at Event

A user broadcasts:                                                    CODON:LOGIN|event.venue|user@wallet|sig=abc123|ttl=60s

Nearby kiosk with matching domain resolves & logs them in.

Smart Lock
Owner emits:                                                          CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|payload:temp-access|sig=ownerkey|exp=2m,target=device:lock01

Lock opens — no pairing, no fingerprinting.

Autonomous Drone
Drone emits:                                                          CODON:SOS|zone5|battery:4%|urgency:high|sig=droneX

1.10 Authorship & Future

SirrayaCodon Spec v1 was authored by Mr. Amir Hameed Mir, solo founder of the Sirraya project — to open a new chapter in invisible, respectful, programmable interactions for the age of ambient intelligence.

This document will evolve under RFC-style community contributions. Proposals, suggestions, and new resolver types are welcome.


Section 2: Codon Schema

This section defines the formal schema for Codons in Sirraya Protocol — both human-readable and machine-parseable representations, as well as strict and flexible formats. It will cover:

2.1 Human-Friendly Format (HFF)
A Codon can be transmitted as a compact string, readable by both humans and machines:

CODON:ACTION|CONTEXT|PAYLOAD|META|TELEOMERE

Example:   CODON:UNLOCK|home.frontdoor|token:abc123|sig=xyz098|exp=1m,target=device:lock01

2.2 Structured (Machine) Format (JSON)

Codons are internally parsed into this structured form:
{
  "codon": "UNLOCK",
  "context": {
    "domain": "home.frontdoor",
    "geo": "lat=33.777, long=75.323",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "payload": {
    "type": "token",
    "value": "abc123"
  },
  "meta": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "issuer": "wallet:user123",
    "sig": "xyz098",
    "ts": "2025-04-18T15:00:00Z"
  },
  "teleomere": {
    "ttl": "1m",
    "target": "device:lock01"
  }
}

2.3 Codon Fields Specification

Field	                                      Description	                                                           Required
codon	                                      Instruction/action identifier (e.g. UNLOCK, DISPLAY, REQUEST)	            ✅ Yes
context	                                      Domain, subdomain, or environmental constraints	                        ✅ Yes
payload	                                      Content or data encoded in the codon (can be encrypted)	                ✅ Yes
meta	                                      Version, issuer ID, optional digital signature, timestamp	                ✅ Yes

2.4 Payload Types
Payloads can be flexible based on domain use-case:

text:           Human message or instruction

token:          Authorization token or API key

ref:            External reference or pointer (e.g. URL, hash)

binary:         Image/audio/blob in base64

encrypted:      Encoded with issuer’s key, resolver knows the decryptor


2.5 Signature Handling (meta.sig)

Sirraya supports pluggable cryptographic systems:

sig can be a base64 encoded hash

Can support ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA-based signatures

Verifier module optional for light resolvers

2.6 Teleomere Filters

Teleomere ensures non-global resolution — avoids flooding the ambient space.


Key	Purpose	Format

ttl	                    Time-to-live (1s to 24h or more)	5s, 1m, 3h
target	                Resolver identity filter	device:id, group, role

scope	                Spatial or logical zone	geo, mesh, etc.


2.7 Codon Hashing (CID)

Each codon optionally generates a CID (Codon ID):

cid = hash(codon_body + sig)

Resolvers may use CID to avoid reprocessing known codons.

2.8 Minimal Codon (no sig, no payload)

CODON:PING|mesh.zone01|||exp=30s

2.9 Example Variants

Event-based Entry:       CODON:ENTRY|venue.amsaa.event|user:guest123|sig=xyz|ttl=1h

Ad-hoc Purchase:         CODON:BUY|popshop.kashmir|product:saffron10g|sig=wallet:amsaa_user|ttl=90s

2.10 Codon Lifecycle States

Emission →               By emitter (person/device/agent)

Floating →               Available ambiently for listeners

Reception →              Device receives and parses

Resolution →             If matched by resolver

Mutation (optional) →    Codon is extended or changed by another agent

Expiry →                 Time runs out (teleomere triggers death)


2.11 Mutation Markers (meta)

meta: {
  mutation: {
    by: "user123",
    type: "extend",
    fields: ["payload"]
  }
}

2.12 Reserved Fields

Machine-parseable

Human-readable

Secure by design

Usable across any domain

Compatible with edge and offline systems


## Section 3: Parsing & Resolution

This section explains how Codons are parsed and resolved by devices, agents, and systems. It also defines the principles behind parsing, resolution logic, and potential use cases.

---

### 3.1 Parsing a Codon

Parsing a Codon involves breaking down the emitted Codon string into its structured components for further processing.

A Codon string typically follows the format:         CODON:ACTION|CONTEXT|PAYLOAD|META|TELEOMERE

The parser takes the raw Codon string and converts it into an internal structured format.

Example:

Given the Codon string:                               CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|payload:token:abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1m,target=device:lock01

After parsing, it would be converted into the following structured format:

{
  "codon": "UNLOCK",
  "context": {
    "domain": "home.doorlock",
    "payload": "token:abc123"
  },
  "meta": {
    "sig": "ownerkey",
    "exp": "1m"
  },
  "teleomere": {
    "target": "device:lock01"
  }
}


3.2 Resolution Process

Once a Codon is parsed, the resolver checks the parsed content and decides whether it can resolve the Codon and take action. Resolution is based on:

Matching the context:           The domain, target, and other context fields must match the capabilities or permissions of the resolver.

Validity check:                 The resolver checks the validity of the Codon (e.g., checking if it is expired, if the target device is available, etc.).

Action triggering:              If the Codon is valid, the resolver triggers the corresponding action (e.g., unlocking a door, sending a notification).


The resolver may also interact with the handler, which executes specific logic based on the action of the Codon.


Example of resolution:

A mobile phone receives a Codon for unlocking a smart lock.

The phone's resolver checks if the phone is within range of the lock, verifies the signature, and checks if the TTL (time-to-live) has expired.

If everything matches, the smart lock is unlocked.



3.3 Context Matching

Context is key for the resolution process. Codons are matched with resolvers based on the domain, subdomain, or logical region specified in the context field.

Context can include:

Geographic location:                Where the Codon should be resolved.

Domain:                             The specific service or system associated with the Codon (e.g., home.doorlock, event.checkin).

Time and scheduling:                Time filters such as expiration or scheduled resolution times.

Device-specific:                    Targeting specific devices or devices in a group (e.g., device:lock01).


Context allows for filtered and intent-driven resolution — the Codon resolves only if the system is able to match its specified context.

3.4 Teleomere Filters

The teleomere field defines when and where a Codon can be resolved, adding another layer of filtering before resolution happens.


Common teleomere filters include:

TTL (Time-to-live):               Specifies how long the Codon is valid before it expires.

Target:                           Defines the specific device, agent, or system that can resolve the Codon. For example, it can target a specific device (e.g., device:smartlock01).

Scope:                            Defines logical or spatial constraints — for example, resolving the Codon only within a geographic region (e.g., geo:home, geo:kashmir).

Relay hop count:                  How many intermediary hops are allowed before the Codon expires or is resolved.


3.5 Validity Checks

The validity check is an essential part of resolution to ensure that a Codon is genuine and authorized to trigger actions.

Common validity checks include:

Expiration (TTL):                   If the TTL has expired, the Codon cannot be resolved.

Signature:                          The signature ensures that the Codon is authorized to perform an action, and can be verified using the resolver's public key.

Target matching:                    The Codon’s target must match the device or system capable of resolving the action.

For example, if a Codon has the field exp=5m, the resolver will only process the Codon if it is received within the 5-minute window.

3.6 Action Handlers

An action handler is the mechanism that executes the desired action when a Codon is successfully resolved.

The handler function may vary based on the type of action defined in the Codon.

For example:

Unlock Action:                      The handler for a UNLOCK Codon might send a signal to the smart lock to disengage.

Notification Action:                The handler for a NOTIFY Codon might send a message to a user’s phone.

Payment Action:                     The handler for a PAY Codon could initiate a transaction via a payment gateway.

Each handler is typically defined by the resolver in charge of the action. The handler will receive the resolved Codon and use its payload to perform the desired operation.

3.7 Handling Errors
The resolution process may encounter errors, which should be captured and handled appropriately.

Some common errors include:


Code	Error Description
E001	Codon expired
E002	Invalid signature
E003	Target device not found
E004	Missing required metadata
E005	Unsupported action type


When an error occurs, the system may respond by ignoring the Codon, reporting the error back to the emitter, or triggering a fallback action.


3.8 Example: Resolving a Codon
Let’s take an example of resolving a UNLOCK Codon for a smart lock:

Codon emission: The Codon is emitted by the user to unlock a smart door lock.


CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token:abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=5m,target=device:lock01

Parsing: The receiving device parses the Codon, extracting the action (UNLOCK), context (home.doorlock), and target (device:lock01).

Resolution: The device checks if the current time is within the TTL (5 minutes) and if the signature matches.

Action Handling: If the Codon is valid, the handler for the UNLOCK action is triggered, unlocking the smart lock.

Expiry: If the TTL expires or if any of the checks fail, the Codon is ignored or an error response is sent.


3.9 Optimizing Resolution

As Codons are emitted in diverse environments, the resolution process can be optimized for performance:

Caching resolvers:          For frequently used Codons or resolvers, caching allows quicker resolution.

Edge resolution:            Codons can be resolved at the edge, without needing to send data to a central server, improving speed and reducing latency.

Asynchronous processing:    Some resolutions may be delayed or deferred to avoid blocking critical system actions.

3.10 Conclusion

The parsing and resolution of Codons enable devices and systems to interact based on dynamic, context-driven rules. The flexibility of the Sirraya Protocol ensures that actions can be triggered securely and efficiently without requiring persistent connections or traditional user interfaces. This decentralized and flexible approach allows for real-time, ambient interactions in diverse environments.

## Section 4: Security & Integrity

This section covers the security mechanisms built into the Sirraya Codon protocol to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of emitted Codons.



### 4.1 Cryptographic Security

Sirraya Codons rely on cryptographic techniques to ensure that data remains secure throughout the emission, parsing, resolution, and action phases.

#### Key Security Features:

1. Signature Verification: Codons are signed using public-key cryptography. The signature is used to verify that the Codon was emitted by an authorized source.

2. Encryption: Sensitive data in the Codon, such as payload or meta-data, may be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Hashing: The Codon can include hashed values to verify data integrity.

---

### 4.2 Signature and Authentication

A **signature** ensures that a Codon has not been tampered with during transmission and that it comes from a trusted source. 

- **Signing Process**: When a Codon is emitted, it is signed by the emitter's private key.

- **Verification Process**: The receiver verifies the signature using the emitter's public key.

Example:

Codon string: CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token:abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1m

The sig=ownerkey portion represents the signature that is used for authentication. The resolver will use the emitter's public key to verify the authenticity of the Codon.

4.3 Encryption and Decryption

Sensitive information in the Codon, such as access tokens or personal data, can be encrypted using symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms.

Encryption: The payload or certain meta-data can be encrypted before being added to the Codon string.

Decryption: The recipient decrypts the data using the appropriate decryption key or process.

Example:

A Codon might contain an encrypted payload for a payment system, like so:


CODON:PAY|payment.gateway|encPayload=xyz123|sig=merchantkey|exp=1h

The encPayload=xyz123 is encrypted data, which can be decrypted by the system with the appropriate decryption key.

4.4 Hashing and Integrity Verification

To ensure that the data within the Codon has not been altered, hashing is used to verify its integrity.

Hashing: A cryptographic hash is applied to the Codon string (excluding the signature). This hash is included in the Codon metadata.

Integrity Check: Upon receiving the Codon, the system computes the hash of the entire Codon string and compares it to the hash stored in the metadata. If they match, the Codon is valid.

Example:    CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token:abc123|sig=ownerkey|hash=abcd1234

The system calculates the hash of the Codon and compares it with abcd1234. If they match, the data integrity is verified.

4.5 Confidentiality

To maintain confidentiality, all Codon payloads and sensitive metadata can be encrypted or obfuscated.

End-to-End Encryption: The entire Codon or specific fields (such as the payload) can be encrypted between the emitter and the receiver, ensuring that unauthorized parties cannot read the data.

Obfuscation: In certain scenarios, Codons may employ obfuscation techniques to hide sensitive information.

4.6 Identity and Trust

Identity management is essential for ensuring that only authorized parties can emit or resolve Codons.

Trusted Identities: Devices, users, and systems are assigned identities (public keys, digital certificates) to ensure trust.

Certificate Authorities (CA): For enhanced security, a system of trusted Certificate Authorities may be used to verify the legitimacy of identities.

Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Only users or systems with the proper roles and permissions are allowed to emit or resolve certain Codons.

4.7 Tamper Detection

To detect tampering, Codons can include checksum values, digital signatures, or time-based tokens that make unauthorized changes easily detectable.

Checksum: A checksum is a simple, but effective, method for detecting whether a Codon has been altered in transit.

Digital Signatures: The digital signature ensures that any tampering would invalidate the Codon, preventing its resolution.

Time-based Tokens: These tokens ensure that a Codon is not reused after a certain period.

4.8 Example: Secure Payment Codon

Consider a Codon used for a secure payment transaction. It might look like this:


CODON:PAY|payment.gateway|encPayload=encryptedData|sig=merchantkey|hash=1234abcd|exp=1h

The encPayload contains encrypted transaction details.

The sig field contains the merchant's signature, authenticating the source.

The hash field ensures data integrity.

The exp field ensures that the Codon is valid for only 1 hour.

The system will:

Verify the signature using the merchant’s public key.

Decrypt the payload if needed.

Check the hash for integrity.

Ensure that the Codon has not expired before processing the payment.

4.9 Security Best Practices

To ensure robust security in the Sirraya Codon system, consider implementing the following best practices:

Use Strong Encryption:                  Always use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to protect sensitive data.

Use Secure Signature Algorithms:        Use secure digital signature algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDSA) to ensure authenticity.

Regularly Rotate Keys:                  Change cryptographic keys regularly to mitigate risks from key compromise.

Apply Least Privilege:                  Ensure that each entity (device, user, system) has the minimum required permissions to perform its tasks.

Monitor for Anomalies:                  Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior or attempts at tampering with Codons.

Enforce Expiry Times:                   Always ensure that Codons have an expiration time to minimize the risk of reuse.

## Section 5: Emission and Resolution

This section outlines how Codons are emitted, resolved, and the interaction between emitters and resolvers.



### 5.1 Emission Process

The emission of a Codon involves the creation of a structured message by an emitter (e.g., a device, service, or user), which conveys specific instructions or data.

1. **Codon Creation**: The emitter creates the Codon string, which can contain:

   - **Action**: The intended action (e.g., `UNLOCK`, `PAY`, `SET`) that the resolver needs to perform.
   - **Payload**: Optional data or parameters necessary for executing the action.
   - **Signature**: A cryptographic signature to authenticate the emitter.
   - **Expiration**: An optional time-based expiration for the Codon.

2. **Transmission**: The Codon is then transmitted to one or more resolvers (systems that interpret and execute the Codon).

**Example of an Emitted Codon**:

CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

In this example, the emitter is requesting that the home.doorlock be unlocked using the token=abc123. The emission is signed with ownerkey and is valid for 1 hour (exp=1h).

5.2 Resolution Process

The resolution process is the step where a resolver takes action based on the received Codon.

Codon Reception: The resolver receives the Codon message and processes its content.

Verification:

Signature Validation:          The resolver checks the signature to ensure the Codon is from a trusted source.

Hash Integrity:                The resolver verifies that the Codon’s integrity is intact by comparing the received hash with the calculated hash.

Expiration Check:              The resolver checks if the Codon is expired by comparing the current time with the expiration time.

Execution:                     Once validated, the resolver executes the action specified in the Codon, such as unlocking a device, processing a payment, or updating a system state.


Example of Codon Resolution:

For the previously emitted Codon:  CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

The resolver (e.g., a smart home system) will:

Validate the signature using the public key of the owner.

Check if the current time is within the valid expiration time (exp=1h).

Unlock the door if the validation is successful.

5.3 Codon Parsing

Parsing refers to the process of extracting relevant data from a Codon and making sense of it.

Decoding the Action:            The resolver first identifies the action (e.g., UNLOCK, PAY).

Extracting Parameters:          After identifying the action, the resolver extracts any associated parameters (e.g., token=abc123).

Payload Interpretation:         If there is a payload (e.g., encrypted data), the resolver decodes and processes it accordingly.

Execution Logic:                Based on the extracted data, the resolver executes the corresponding action, which may include invoking other services or systems.

Example of Codon Parsing:

For the Codon:                 CODON:PAY|payment.gateway|amount=100|sig=merchantkey|exp=30m

The resolver would:

Identify that the action is PAY.

Extract the payment parameters, such as amount=100.

Verify the authenticity of the payment using merchantkey.

Ensure that the Codon has not expired (exp=30m).

Process the payment using the provided gateway.

5.4 Multiple Resolvers and Dispatch

A single Codon can be sent to multiple resolvers, depending on the use case. For example, a Codon may trigger actions in multiple devices or systems simultaneously.

Broadcasting:               The Codon can be broadcast to multiple resolvers for parallel processing. This is especially useful in IoT applications, where multiple devices need to take action in response to the same event.

Chained Resolution:         A Codon can be designed to trigger actions in a chain of resolvers. Each resolver performs a task and then forwards the Codon to the next resolver in the chain.

Example of Broadcast:      CODON:UPDATE|smart.light|state=on|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

In this case, the smart.light system, smart.fan, and smart.ac could all receive the same Codon to update their states simultaneously.

5.5 Error Handling and Failure Recovery

Codons may fail during the emission or resolution process due to various reasons, such as invalid signatures, expired Codons, or communication failures.

Error Responses: A resolver can respond with an error Codon, providing a message about the failure. For example, if a Codon has expired, the resolver may send a FAIL Codon with an error message.


Retry Mechanisms: Codons can be configured with retry logic. If a resolver fails to process a Codon, it can automatically retry after a specified time.


Fallback Systems: If a primary resolver is unavailable, a fallback system can handle the resolution process.


Example of an Error Response:  CODON:FAIL|error=expired|original=CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

In the case of an expired Codon, the resolver would return a failure message, along with the original Codon that caused the error.


5.6 Codon Life Cycle

A Codon follows a defined life cycle from emission to resolution. This life cycle includes the following stages:

Emission:               The Codon is created by the emitter and transmitted to the resolver.

Verification:           The resolver validates the Codon by checking the signature, integrity, and expiration.

Execution:              The resolver executes the action specified by the Codon.

Completion:             The Codon has been processed successfully, and any result or feedback is returned.

Failure Handling:       If a failure occurs at any point, the Codon enters the failure handling stage, where appropriate actions (e.g., retries, error responses) are taken.


5.7 Example: Full Codon Resolution Flow
Here is an example of the entire process, from emission to resolution:

Emission:                       CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

Transmission:                   The Codon is sent to the smart home system.

Reception and Verification:     The smart home system checks the signature, hash, and expiration.

Execution:                      If valid, the system unlocks the door.

Completion:                     The system returns a success response.

## Section 6: Security Considerations

This section outlines the security measures necessary for ensuring that Codons remain secure throughout their lifecycle.



### 6.1 Signature Authentication

Each Codon is signed using a private key to ensure its authenticity and to prevent tampering during transmission.

1. **Signature Generation**: The emitter generates a cryptographic signature for each Codon before transmission. The signature is created using the emitter's private key, ensuring that only the emitter can produce valid signatures.

2. **Signature Validation**: The resolver verifies the signature using the emitter's public key. If the signature is valid, the Codon is considered authentic.

3. **Signature Format**: The signature is appended to the Codon as a separate field, ensuring it can be independently verified.

**Example**:

CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

In this example, sig=ownerkey represents the cryptographic signature generated by the emitter using their private key.


6.2 Encryption and Privacy

To protect sensitive data, Codons can be encrypted before transmission. This ensures that any sensitive information included in the Codon, such as tokens or personal identifiers, is unreadable to unauthorized parties.

Data Encryption:        The payload of the Codon, such as a user’s credentials or payment details, can be encrypted using a public key encryption algorithm.

Data Decryption:        The resolver, possessing the corresponding private key, decrypts the payload to access the sensitive data.


Example:

A Codon might contain encrypted payment information. The resolver would decrypt it to execute a payment transaction.

6.3 Authentication and Authorization

Before executing any actions based on a Codon, resolvers must authenticate and authorize the emitter.

Authentication:             The resolver ensures that the emitter is who they claim to be by verifying the signature of the Codon.

Authorization:              The resolver checks if the emitter has permission to perform the requested action. For example, only a trusted user or admin may be authorized to unlock a door or process a payment.

Example:

If the emitter’s signature matches the public key but is not listed as an authorized user, the resolver might reject the action with a FAIL Codon.

6.4 Expiration and Time Constraints

To prevent stale or invalid Codons from being executed, Codons include expiration times, after which they are no longer valid.

Expiration Time:            Each Codon can have an expiration time specified in the exp field. Once the expiration time has passed, the Codon becomes invalid, and any attempts to execute it will fail.

Time Synchronization:       The resolver and emitter should synchronize their clocks to ensure the accurate validation of expiration times.

Example:  CODON:PAY|payment.gateway|amount=100|sig=merchantkey|exp=30m

In this example, the exp=30m ensures that the Codon is only valid for 30 minutes.

6.5 Replay Protection

To protect against the replay of valid but outdated Codons, a nonce (number used once) can be included in the Codon to ensure that it cannot be reused.

Nonce Generation: The emitter generates a unique nonce for each Codon. This nonce is included in the Codon and must be unique for each request.

Nonce Verification: The resolver checks that the nonce has not been used before. If the nonce has already been seen, the Codon is rejected.

Example:  CODON:UPDATE|smart.light|state=on|nonce=12345|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

The resolver checks that nonce=12345 has not been used previously. If it has been used, the resolver will reject the Codon.

6.6 Secure Communication Channels
Codons should be transmitted over secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to prevent interception and tampering during transit.

Encrypted Transmission:             Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure that Codons are encrypted during transmission between the emitter and resolver.

Integrity Checks:                   Use hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) or similar methods to ensure the integrity of the Codon during transmission.

Example:

A Codon emitted from a smart lock would be transmitted over HTTPS to ensure that the data is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping.

6.7 Error and Failure Handling
Codons should include provisions for error handling and recovery, ensuring that failures are detected, logged, and appropriately addressed.

Failure Notifications: When a resolver cannot process a Codon due to an error, it should return a failure response, providing details on the nature of the error.

Retry Logic: For transient errors (e.g., network failures), Codons should support retry logic, allowing them to be retried at later intervals.

Example: CODON:FAIL|error=timeout|original=CODON:UNLOCK|home.doorlock|token=abc123|sig=ownerkey|exp=1h

In this case, a FAIL Codon is returned, indicating that the unlock action could not be performed due to a timeout.



6.8 Conclusion

The security of Codons is paramount, and the use of signatures, encryption, expiration times, and secure communication channels ensures that Codons can be transmitted and executed securely. These measures help protect both the emitter and the resolver from various threats, including data interception, unauthorized access, and replay attacks.
